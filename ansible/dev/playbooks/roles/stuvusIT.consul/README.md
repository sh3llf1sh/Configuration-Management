# consul

This role sets up a simple Consul cluster on a group of Ansible hosts.
There is no ACL configuration or TLS configuration.

You need internet access on the control machine to download Consul.
Consul will be compiled on the control machine instead of the target machine.

**This playbook requires the `linear` strategy!**

## Requirements

An apt- or pacman-based Linux distribution on both the control machine and the targets.
The control machine can also use the yum package manager.
If another distribution is used, the packages for `git`, `go`, and `make` need to be installed on the control machine and `go` needs to be installed on the targets.
